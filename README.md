# Student-Scores--DS-project
The uploaded Jupyter notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset named student-mat.csv, which captures various demographic, social, and academic attributes of students to understand their performance, especially in mathematics. The dataset comprises 395 rows and 33 columns, with features such as study time, failures, parental education, and final grade (G3). The analysis begins by importing essential Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

After loading the dataset using the appropriate separator (;), the notebook performs basic data exploration. It confirms that there are no missing values and that all data types are correctly formatted. Duplicate records are identified and removed to ensure the integrity of the analysis. The dataset is then used to explore patterns and generate insights into student performance.

One of the first analytical steps is calculating the average final grade (G3), which is found to be approximately 10.42 out of 20. The analysis also investigates the relationship between study time and performance. While there is a positive correlation (around 0.10), it is relatively weak, indicating that other factors may significantly influence grades. Additionally, a gender-based comparison reveals that male students have a slightly higher average score (10.91) compared to female students (9.96).

The grade distribution is another important aspect examined in the notebook. It is observed that most students score between 10 and 15, with a few outliers scoring below 5 or above 18. These insights suggest a generally moderate performance trend with a small number of both high achievers and underperformers. Overall, the notebook offers a clear and structured exploration of student performance data, paving the way for deeper analysis or predictive modeling if desired.
